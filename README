Apache MyFaces CODI sample: Different scopes...

TODO:
after switching to MyFaces JSF impl, following error occured:
initializing MyFaces: URI scheme is not "file": java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: URI scheme is not "file"

see: http://seamframework.org/Community/CannotSerializeSessionAttributeOrgapachemyfacesviewfaceletsDefaultFaceletsStateManagementHelperSERIALIZEDVIEWForSession4F66763ACB1F009D75674C8225413B30JavaioNotSerializableExceptionOrgjbossweldbeanManagedBean

Application works partially as expected:
* JSF2 RequestScope does work as expected
* JSF2 ViewScope does _not_ work: it seems not to be initialized
* CODI Conversation and CODI Window-Scope do work as expected
* CODI ViewAccessScoped does _not_ work as expected: it has been initialized, but never expires
